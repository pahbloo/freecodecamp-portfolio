# My freeCodeCamp Portfolio

This is my portfolio of freeCodeCamp projects. It is also
[a freeCodeCamp project][1] itself. You can see all of my FCC certifications on
[my freeCodeCamp profile][2].

## Description

This portfolio page is build with the custom `build.ts` deno script. It
processes the files from the `src` folder, and sends the results to the `public`
folder, which is served by GitHub Pages.

The `projects.json` file contains a list of my other freeCodeCamp project repos.
Through the GitHub API, the build script gets all the necessary information and
an updated screenshot for each project.

## Contributing

As this is a personal project, I'm not accepting pull requests. But I'll feel
glad if you open an issue for some bug you found or some new features or
suggestion.
